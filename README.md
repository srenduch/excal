Building for Linux

Download and install the latest stable versions of ``Python`` and ``pip``. Then navigate to the project root directory.
Build instructions are available in ``/Dockerfile``.

If you choose to build a docker image, you can do that by using
``docker build .``

The process is similar for Windows and macOS environments.
